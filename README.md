The purpose of this project is to create a website where the user sells candles.
I've create a wireframe in Figma that can be found here: https://www.figma.com/file/wFxJ8ZUoPlH9lODPYgR8cg/Candle_Project?node-id=7%3A4
Technology used in this project
-> React.js (Front-End)
-> Json-Server (Database)

I will be making incremental changes as time goes on. Some examples include

-> Add a checkout page
-> Switch from using Json-Server to postgreSQL
-> Implement some bootstrap UI
-> Host the site on a platform
